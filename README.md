# AI Blog with GPT-4 and Next.js

This project is a blog web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prisma, and GPT-4 AI. Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. 

## Project Setup

1. **Set up Next.js and TypeScript:**  
   This application is built using Next.js with TypeScript for type safety and scalability. Follow the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for setup instructions.

2. **Set up ESLint and Prettier:**  
   We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and enforce coding style guidelines. You can find setup instructions in the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) docs.

3. **Create Database Schema:**  
   The database schema for this application includes tables for users, blog posts, and more. You can view the schema in the `/prisma` directory.

4. **Integrate Prisma:**  
   Prisma is used in this project to facilitate database operations. You can check out the Prisma setup guide [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started).

5. **Create Authentication system:**  
   User authentication is handled with secure password hashing and session management. 

6. **Implement Blog Post CRUD operations:**  
   Users have the ability to create, read, update, and delete their blog posts.

7. **Create a Post Viewing Page:**  
   Each blog post has a unique URL that users can visit to view the full post.

8. **Create a User Profile Page:**  
   Users have profile pages where they can view and edit their personal information.

9. **Implement GPT-4 AI Integration:**  
   This application includes integration with GPT-4 AI, enabling AI-assisted blog post creation.

10. **Write Unit Tests:**  
    Unit tests for components and functions can be found in the `/tests` directory. Run the tests with `npm run test`.

11. **Perform Integration Testing:**  
    Integration testing ensures all parts of the application work together properly.

12. **Implement Responsive Design:**  
    The application is built with a responsive design, making it compatible with devices of different screen sizes.

13. **Deploy the Application:**  
    Deployment is handled with Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions.
